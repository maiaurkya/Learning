erminate session:

Use command: ZZ

Use command line: ":wq"
Save (write) changes to current file and quit Save.
Use command line: ":w"
Save (write) changes to current file without quitting Save.
Use command line: ":w!"
Save (write) changes to current file overriding the file permissions if the user has the privileges to change the file permissions. For example this will save a file with read only privileges if the user is the owner or has the ability to modify the privileges to allow a write. This will not permanently modify the file privileges. Note that there is no space between the two characters. A space will infer that the output is streamed to a Unix command following the "!" Save.
Use command line: ":w filename"
Save (write) changes to a new file of name "filename" without quitting Save.
Use command line: ":q!"
Ignore changes and quit. No changes from last write will be saved.
Use command line: ":qa"
Quit all files opened.
New session:

Use command: ":e filename"
Start new edit session on specified file name without closing current vi / vim editor process..
